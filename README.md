## Description 

Age Claculator app is a project as a web page that get day , month and year of your birth and Calculate your age and return your current year , month and day. I used most common languages of front end developing : javaScript and html , css.
the recursive numbers are most  most accurate value becuse even the leap years has Considered.
    
Claculating age with the least difference with real value was one of most **important challnges** of this project



**It is very likely the dark them be added to age claculator**
